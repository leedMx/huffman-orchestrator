# huffman-orchestrator

This is a proof of concept for my sample implementation of an endpoint that provides huffman encoding.

For now the project only works for a dev environment and it will ignore requests from origins different to my own domain.

~~~ shell
git pull https://github.com/leedmx/huffman-orchestration
cd huffman-orchestration
docker compose up
